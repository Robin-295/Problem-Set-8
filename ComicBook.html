        <h1>Super Heroes I think are really cool</h1>

        <p>Here's a few superheroes I think are really cool, or have been important in my life.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Batman</li>
            <details>
                <summary>Bruce Wayne</summary>
                <p>Wears a bat costume, likes to brood.</p>
            </details>
            <li>Superman</li>
            <details>
                <summary>Clark Kent</summary>
                <p>Wears a big "S", likes to rescue cats from trees</p>
            </details>
            <li>Aminal Man</li>
            <details>
                <summary>Buddy Baker</summary>
                <p>Gets his powers from nearby animals, not a very well known super hero</p>
            </details>
        </ul>

        <p>If you've never heard of Animal Man, a good place to start would be to read Grant Morrison's "Animal Man".</p>
